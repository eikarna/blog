title: Why Android Now Sucks
---

On this occasion, I will explain some mistakes that Google has made in its products, with a particular focus on Android. Currently, many Android users are complaining about several features that have been removed and replaced, with some users expressing significant frustration.

## Why Do Many People Say Android Now Sucks?
Here, I will explain what Google has done with Android.

### No More Applications Can Be Installed on SD Card

According to [Behavior Android 11](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage#app-specific-external), there are security enhancements for External Storage (a feature originally introduced in [Android 7](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0#scoped_directory_access)) that prevent users from moving apps to External Storage.

For some people, this may not be a significant issue. However, many software developers are frustrated by this change, as they can no longer move applications to external storage to save internal storage space. Some users want to install games with large data sets, essentially using an external hard drive for game assets and an SSD for core game data.

What was once a useful feature from Android 7 has been destroyed by Google itself.

### LMKd (Low Memory Kill daemon) Reverted to Userspace

According to [Pressure Stall Information](https://source.android.com/docs/core/perf/lmkd#pressure-stall-information), Android 10 and higher support a new LMKd mode that uses kernel pressure stall information (PSI) for memory pressure detection.

You might think this has no significant effect, but in reality, it can cause serious problems. This change has led to poor memory management and can create frustrating user experiences. Imagine multitasking with several applications, only to have one forcibly killed by LMKd.

Many people complain about poor memory management due to updates implemented by Google. This issue is evident in various Android skins like MIUI, HyperOS, ColorOS, and many others.

### Privacy and Ads Issues
Google is increasingly aggressively collecting user data through Android services. Many users are uncomfortable with:
- In-depth tracking of user activity
- Increasingly invasive ads on various Google services
- Lack of full control over personal data

### Slow Security Updates
Majority of Android devices:
- Do not receive security updates consistently
- Only receive short updates (1-2 years)
- In contrast to iOS which provides longer update support

### Operating System Fragmentation
The classic unresolved problem of Android:
- Each vendor has a different version of Android
- Not all devices get the latest updates
- Significant interface differences between brands

### Restrictions on Customization
Compared to previous versions, Android now:
- Restricts users' freedom to customize
- Reduces root and system modification options
- Makes advanced settings difficult for advanced users

### Performance Issues
Common user complaints include:
- More and more built-in apps that cannot be uninstalled
- Inefficient battery consumption
- Performance that degrades over time

### Increasing Ecosystem Costs
- Prices of flagship Android smartphones now equal or even exceed iPhones
- Premium features are increasingly restricted and controlled by certain brands
- Ever-increasing component and technology costs

### Complex Security Issues
- Vulnerability of the operating system to malware
- Many security holes in the Play Store
- Difficult app verification process

### Reduced Innovation
- Smartphone designs are starting to look monotonous
- Most new features are only incremental
- Lack of revolutionary breakthroughs

### Domination of Ads and Tracking
- Google is getting more aggressive in collecting data
- Increasingly intrusive ads
- Lack of transparency in the use of personal data

### Ecosystem Complexity
- Too many interface variations
- Differences in features between vendors
- Difficulty of data migration between devices

title: Why is Android now is Sucks
---

On this occasion, I will explain some mistakes that Google has made in some of its products, one of the most important of which is Android.
Currently, many Android users are complaining about several features that have been removed and replaced, and there are even some user angry about it.

So, why many peoples said Android now is sucks?
here i will explain what googol done yet with they Android.

# No more Application can be installed on SDCard
![Android 11](https://developer.android.com/static/images/about/versions/11/android11_black.png)

According to [Behavior Android 11](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage?hl=id#app-specific-external), there is some security enhancement for External Storage which the feature is from [Behavior Android 7](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0?hl=id#scoped_directory_access) where users now can't move any Apps to External Storage.
For some people this may not be a problem, but in reality many software developers are angry about this change, where they cannot move applications to external storage for saving their internal storage. Also some peoples said they want to installing games which has Big Data inside, something like using harddisk as assets data game, and ssd as basic data game.
### At the End
this is a useful feature from Android 7 where has been destroyed by Googol itself.

# LMKd (Low Memory Kill daemon) revert to Userspace
![Android 10](https://developer.android.com/static/images/about/versions/10/android10_black.png)

According to [Pressure stall information](https://source.android.com/docs/core/perf/lmkd#pressure-stall-information), they said `Android 10 and higher support a new lmkd mode that uses kernel pressure stall information (PSI) monitors for memory pressure detection.`.
Do you think that this has no effect? You may be right, but in reality it is very wrong. This actually has the effect of causing poor memory management, and can even cause nightmares.
Imagine if you were multitasking to run several applications at once, It turns out that one of these applications was forcibly killed by LMKd.
### At the End
Many people complain about poor memory management, due to updates that have been determined by Googol itself. example is MIUI, HyperOS, ColorOS, and many more.
